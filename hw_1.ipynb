    "a) [3] Take the oscillatory function $f_{\\omega_0}(t) = e^{i\\omega_0\\int_{x_0}^{x} \\Omega(\\sigma)\\mathrm{d}\\sigma}$, whose frequency is expressed as $\\omega(x) = \\omega_0\\Omega(x)$. What is its _relative condition number_ in with respect to $x$, keeping all other quantities constant? What is the relative condition number of $f$ assuming we now only perturb the input parameter $\\omega_0$? What physical quantity associated with the oscillatory function does this latter condition number express?\n",
    "\n",
    "b) [2] If the relative condition number of the real-valued functions $f$ and $g$ are $\\kappa_f$ and $\\kappa_g$ respectively, show that for $h(x) = f(g(x))$, \n",

    "c) [4] The polynomial $p(x) = a_0 + a_1x + \\ldots + a_nx^n$ has a root $x = r$. What is the (relative) condition number of the root $r$ with respect to perturbations in the coefficient $a_k$, keeping all other coefficients constant? Simplify your answer as much as possible. Deduce when root finding problems become ill-conditioned."

To first order in small quantities, what does $\\varepsilon$ have to equal for backwards stability? Assuming $\\varepsilon$ satisfies this condition, how does it behave as all small quantities approach zero, and what does this mean for the backwards stability of the algorithm?\n",

Plot the error curves $(f − p_n)(x)$, $x \\in [−1, 1]$, computed by this algorithm for $f(x) = |x|$ and $0 \\leq n \\leq 25$. Comment on the spacing of the grid $\\{ x_0, x_1, \\ldots, x_{25} \\}$.\n",
