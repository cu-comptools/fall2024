    "### 1. Condition number [9]\n",
    "\n",
    "a) [3] Take the oscillatory function $f_{\\omega_0}(x) = e^{i\\omega_0\\int_{x_0}^{x} \\Omega(\\sigma)\\mathrm{d}\\sigma}$, whose frequency is expressed as $\\omega(x) = \\omega_0\\Omega(x)$. What is its _relative condition number_ in with respect to $x$, keeping all other quantities constant? What is the relative condition number of $f$ assuming we now only perturb the input parameter $\\omega_0$? What physical quantity associated with the oscillatory function does this latter condition number express?\n",
    "\n",
    "b) [2] If the relative condition number of the real-valued functions $f$ and $g$ are $\\kappa_f$ and $\\kappa_g$ respectively, show that for $h(x) = f(g(x))$, \n",
    "\n",

    "c) [4] The polynomial $p(x) = a_0 + a_1x + \\ldots + a_nx^n$ has a root $x = r$. What is the (relative) condition number of the root $r$ with respect to perturbations in the coefficient $a_k$, keeping all other coefficients constant? Simplify your answer as much as possible. Deduce when root finding problems become ill-conditioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Hint_: What is the input and output of the problem (remember, you are doing root finding, not polynomial evaluation, and know that there is one input and one output)? What equation does the root $r$ have to satisfy? What happens to the equation (to first order in small changes) as you perturb the input and output? What is the relative condition number in terms of the perturbations (and the quantities you perturbed)?"

To first order in small quantities, what does $\\varepsilon$ have to equal for backwards stability? Assuming $\\varepsilon$ satisfies this condition, how does it behave as all small quantities approach zero, and what does this mean for the backwards stability of the algorithm?\n",

    "### 3. Interpolation [10]\n",
    "\n",
    "a) [6] Write code using the barycentric interpolation formula (you may use an external package for this, or you may write your own) to compute a sequence of polynomial interpolants to a function $f$ on $[−1, 1]$ in points selected by a _greedy_ algorithm: take $x_0$ to be a point where $|f(x)|$ achieves its maximum, then $x_1$ to be a point where $|(f − p_0)(x)|$ achieves its maximum, then $x_2$ to be a point where $|(f − p_1)(x)|$ achieves its maximum, and so on. Plot the error curves $(f − p_n)(x)$, $x \\in [−1, 1]$, computed by this algorithm for $f(x) = |x|$ and $0 \\leq n \\leq 25$. Comment on the spacing of the grid $\\{ x_0, x_1, \\ldots, x_{25} \\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) [2] Make sure to write a _unit test_ for your interpolation routine, and put \"test\" in the function's name.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Hint_: What's a unit test? It's a basic test of an element of code, e.g. a function. It usually checks that the function works properly by testing a case where the output is known exactly, or it's known within some error bound. Check out papers in JOSS (Journal of Open-Source Software) and their open reviews to find some examples. In Python, it usually has an `assert` statement. Unit tests are important because they make writing long code/larger software easier: good practice is to arrange that they are automatically performed whenever the code gets updated, so you know whether you introduced a bug when making changes, and _where_ that bug occurred. This is called [**continuous integration** (CI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration), and is the cure for _integration hell_. GitHub actions make it easy to set up CI.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) [2] Write _docstrings_ for your functions documenting the types and any limitations on their input, their outputs, and what they do. \n",
    "\n",
    "_Hint_: A docstring should contain at least the following 3 things: what the function does (any limitations), inputs (and their types), and outputs (and their types). They are _required_ for user-facing code, and even if the code never sees the light of day, docstring will make it easier _for you_ to understand what on earth you wrote all those months ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "(In code development, you should ideally do these steps in reverse, i.e. document what your functions do, then think of and implement some tests, then write the function itself!)\n"

    "\n",
    "_Hint:_ How do you derive a theoretical estimate when you don't know the analytic solution of the IVP? Well, there are some things you know about the solution (plot it to see!), and it has a connection to the example in 1 a). Always show your work and justify your answer!
